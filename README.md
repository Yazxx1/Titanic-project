# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses real data from the Titanic ship to predict who survived and who didn't.

The data includes information about each passenger like their age, gender, ticket class, and how much they paid. We use this information to teach a computer to guess if a passenger survived (1) or not (0) using logistics regression.
